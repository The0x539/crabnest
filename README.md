# `crabnest`

A mostly cycle-accurate 6502/NES emulator.
Based on [hawknest](https://github.com/HExSA-Lab/hawknest-skeleton), an emulator I completed as part of a class in school, but rewritten with Rust with audio support and improved accuracy.

It runs Battletoads!
(Though it seems to have trouble loading the ROM I grabbed just now. [Micro Mages](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1065020/Micro_Mages/) works great, though.)

Just specify a ROM path on the command line, or `--help` for more info.

Requires SDL2.
